- HTML
- CSS

- Git

Iâ€™m always trying to improve and learn new things to become better in my field.

## Career Goals
My goal is to work at a reputable company where I can utilize my skills, learn more, and work on interesting projects. I aspire to enhance my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development and become an expert someday.
